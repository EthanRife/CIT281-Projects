## Welcome to Ethan Rife's CIT281 Project Portfolio

In this page I provide links to various projects and labs that I encountered during my time as an undergrad in the CIT281 course at the University of Oregon. Feel free to follow the links to the repos. Note that below the project and labs I have provided a summary of learning objectives from each.

### Project Links

1. [PROJECT 1](https://github.com/EthanRife/cit281-p1.git)
Learning Objectives

After completing this project, I have:

- Gained experience accessing your operating system's command line interface (CLI)
- Gained experience working with CLI commands
- Gained experience working with Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
- Gained experience writing and executing non-web server Node.js JavaScript code

Overview

Project elements:

- Used the command line interface (CLI) of my operating system to create a number of folders
- Listed the folders in a tree-like structure
- Used the ping command, and practiced using the break keyboard sequence
- Created and executed a JavaScript files using Node.js and Visual Studio Code (VSCode) terminal and Run and Debug

2. [PROJECT 2](https://github.com/EthanRife/cit281-p2.git)
Learning Objectives

After completing this project, I have:

- Gained experience using git via your CLI and Visual Studio Code (VSCode) Source Control
- Gained experience writing and executing non-web server Node.js JavaScript code
- Practiced refactoring JavaScript code

Overview

Project elements:

- Used the command line interface (CLI) of your operating system to create and work with a git repository (repo)
- Refactored the JavaScript program from the previous project to practice using git and practice refactoring
- Used git via VSCode
- Created and used a .gitignore file
- Diff split screen

3. [PROJECT 3](https://github.com/EthanRife/cit281-p3.git)
Learning Objectives

After completing this project, I have:

- Gained experience interpreting functional descriptions and specifications to complete an assignment
- Gained experience breaking a project into manageable components
- Gained experience writing and executing non-web server Node.js JavaScript code using VSCode
- Practiced creating and using code modules
- Practiced refactoring using modern JavaScript syntax
- Gained experience writing and executing web server Node.js JavaScript code using VSCode
- Gained experience using Fastify with the GET verb, routes, and query parameters
- Gained experience loading a file and using as a web page

Overview

I created a "coinage" code module that is capable of calculating the total value of coin objects. After completing the "coinage" code module functionality, I then updated the "server" code file as a true Node.js web server using the Fastify package. The updated "server" file displayed an initial web page with web links to to test the "coinage" code. The initial web page will be loaded from a file.

4. [PROJECT 4](https://github.com/EthanRife/cit281-p4.git)
Learning Objectives

After completing this project, I have:

- Gained experience interpreting functional descriptions and specifications to complete an assignment
- Gained experience breaking a project into manageable components
- Gained experience writing and executing non-web server Node.js JavaScript code using VSCode
- Practiced creating and using code modules
- Practiced using modern JavaScript syntax
- Gained experience writing and executing Node.js REST API server using VSCode
- Gained experience using Fastify with the GET verb, routes, and route parameters
- Gained experience working with static data
- Gained experience testing code module without using a web server
- Gained experience using Postman to test web server routes
- Gained experience working with JSON
- Extra credit: Gained experience using Fastify with POST, PUT, and DELETE verbs

Overview

I now created a REST API that works with a "data" source of questions and answers. I have created all of the code to work with the data source using a code module, and tested the code module code using provided testing code. I have also created a Node.js REST API to handle the GET verb. 

5. [PROJECT 5](https://github.com/EthanRife/cit281-p5.git)
Learning Objectives

After completing this project, I would have:

Gained experience working with classes, including class constructors and methods
Gained experience interpreting existing code to design a new class, including constructor and methods
Gained more experience working with code modules
Gained experience executing and debugging Node.js code using VSCode, including module breakpoints
Gained more experience working with Array map() and forEach() methods
Gained experience working with the concept of a gaming loop
Gained more experience working with objects and arrays

Overview

For this project, you would have created a Monster Game program using classes. The game would create monsters with initial life values, and minimum life values for the monster to be alive. Once the game is running, each monster's life would be drained by a random amount, and the game would continue until all of the monsters have died. The game would include a delay before each life drain.

6. [PROJECT 6](https://github.com/EthanRife/cit281-p6.git)
Learning Objectives

After completing this project, I would have:

- Gained experience creating and working classes with inheritance
- Gained more experience creating and working with classes
- Gained more experience debugging code
- Gained more experience using a generic block of code to process data
- Gained more experience interpreting functional descriptions and specifications to complete an assignment
- Gained more experience writing and executing non-web server Node.js JavaScript code using VSCode
- Practiced using modern JavaScript syntax
- Gained more experience working with static data

Overview

I would have created three classes. The first class is the Shape class that will serve as a base class for the other two classes. The second class is the Rectangle class that will inherit from Shape class. A class that inherits from another class can be called the child class of the base, or parent, class. The third class is the Triangle class that also will inherit from the Shape class.

The base Shape class will provide the common functionality of a method that returns the perimeter value. Each of the other two classes will provide their own versions of a method that returns the area value. 

7. [PROJECT 7](https://github.com/EthanRife/CIT281-Projects.git)
